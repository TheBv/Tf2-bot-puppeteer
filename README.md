Sourcemod extension to create and control tf2 bots from sourcepawn land.

Originally created for [TF2-Bot-Replay](https://github.com/TheBv/tf2-bot-replay)

Based of the work from VoiDed's [botcontroller](https://github.com/VoiDeD/sourcemod-botcontroller) and sourcemods example project for extensions.
